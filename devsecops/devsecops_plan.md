### **The Professional DevSecOps Engineer Curriculum**
*(Aligned with principles from industry-leading certifications: SANS, Certified DevSecOps Professional, and standards from NIST & OWASP)*

**Course Objective:** To provide you with the advanced, hands-on skills required to design, implement, and manage a professional DevSecOps program, automating security throughout the entire software development lifecycle.

---

**Module 0: Setting Up Your Professional DevSecOps Lab**
*   **Learning Objectives:**
    *   Install and configure essential tools: Git, Docker, VS Code, and a command-line package manager.
    *   Set up free-tier accounts for GitHub and a major cloud provider (we will use AWS for examples).
    *   Master command-line basics for automation and tool interaction.
*   **Lab Activity:** Full environment setup and verification script to ensure all tools are ready.

---

**Module 1: The DevSecOps Framework: Strategy & Governance**
*   **Learning Objectives:**
    *   Articulate the business case for DevSecOps to leadership.
    *   Apply key security frameworks (NIST Secure Software Development Framework, OWASP SAMM).
    *   Master proactive Threat Modeling techniques (STRIDE for components, PASTA for process).
    *   Define and measure actionable security KPIs (MTTR, Vulnerability Density, Patching Cadence).
*   **Hands-on Lab:** Conduct and document a formal STRIDE threat model for a sample web application.

---

**Module 2: Developer-Centric Security (The "Shift Left" in Practice)**
*   **Learning Objectives:**
    *   Go beyond the OWASP Top 10: Implement secure coding for modern architectures.
    *   Integrate real-time security feedback directly into the IDE.
    *   Implement and customize pre-commit hooks to automatically block secrets and code quality issues.
*   **Hands-on Lab:**
    *   **Tools:** `SonarLint` (in VS Code), `Gitleaks` (for pre-commit hooks).
    *   **Task:** Find and fix vulnerabilities in a sample application in real-time within the IDE, then write a custom pre-commit hook to prevent a sensitive file from ever being committed.

---

**Module 3: Building the Secure CI/CD Pipeline**
*   **Learning Objectives:**
    *   Design a hardened, event-driven CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Integrate and automate security testing gates: SAST, SCA, and DAST.
    *   Generate, attest, and utilize a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for supply chain security.
*   **Hands-on Lab:**
    *   **Tools:** GitHub Actions, `SonarCloud` (SAST), `Trivy` (SCA & SBOM), `OWASP ZAP` (DAST).
    *   **Task:** Build a production-grade GitHub Actions workflow that runs SAST and SCA on every pull request, blocking merges with critical vulnerabilities.

---

**Module 4: Securing Infrastructure: IaC and Containers**
*   **Learning Objectives:**
    *   Write secure, compliant, and reusable Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform.
    *   Automate IaC security scanning within the pipeline.
    *   Master Docker security: Multi-stage builds, image hardening, and vulnerability scanning.
    *   Implement foundational Kubernetes security controls (RBAC, Network Policies, Pod Security Standards).
*   **Hands-on Lab:**
    *   **Tools:** `Checkov` (IaC Scanning), `Trivy` (Image Scanning), `Kube-bench` (K8s benchmark).
    *   **Task:** Scan a Terraform project with Checkov. Build a minimal, hardened Docker image, scan it with Trivy, and push it to a private registry (e.g., AWS ECR).

---

**Module 5: Advanced Secrets Management & Zero Trust**
*   **Learning Objectives:**
    *   Understand the principles of dynamic secrets and zero-trust architecture.
    *   Implement a centralized secrets management solution for applications and CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Hands-on Lab:**
    *   **Tool:** HashiCorp Vault.
    *   **Task:** Deploy a Vault server. Configure an application to fetch database credentials dynamically from Vault, eliminating static passwords from its configuration.

---

**Module 6: Cloud Security & Policy as Code**
*   **Learning Objectives:**
    *   Implement Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) using cloud-native tools.
    *   Design and secure serverless applications (AWS Lambda).
    *   Enforce infrastructure and security policies using Policy as Code (PaC).
*   **Hands-on Lab:**
    *   **Tools:** AWS Security Hub, `Open Policy Agent (OPA)`.
    *   **Task:** Write an OPA policy to enforce that all AWS S3 buckets must have encryption enabled. Test this policy against your Terraform code.

---

**Module 7: Security Observability & Response**
*   **Learning Objectives:**
    *   Develop a comprehensive security logging and monitoring strategy.
    *   Differentiate between monitoring, logging, and true observability.
    *   Correlate security events and create high-fidelity alerts.
*   **Hands-on Lab:**
    *   **Tools:** Elastic Stack (or AWS OpenSearch).
    *   **Task:** Stream application and infrastructure logs to a centralized platform. Create a dashboard to visualize security events and configure an automated alert for a specific threat (e.g., multiple failed logins from a single IP).

---

**Capstone Project: End-to-End DevSecOps Implementation**
*   **Project:** You will be given a vulnerable three-tier web application. Your task is to build a complete, secure CI/CD pipeline from scratch that automatically deploys it to AWS. The final solution must include:
    1.  A documented threat model.
    2.  A secure GitHub Actions pipeline with SAST, SCA, and IaC scanning.
    3.  Hardened, scanned container images.
    4.  Dynamic secrets management for the database.
    5.  A security observability dashboard.
